----------------------------ViewData And ViewBag-------------------------------------
 Both are used to pass data toview from controller.
 ViewBag doesn't provide any compile time error checking if we misspell the Viewbag dynamic property.
 ViewData also doesn't provide compile time error checking. 
 We must use strongly type view models. Its the best practice. 
 View data use keys.
 ViewBag use properties.
